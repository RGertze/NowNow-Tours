# ⚡ URGENT: Cloudflare Pages Build Configuration Required

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

Your site is still serving raw TypeScript files instead of compiled JavaScript!

### 🔧 Fix This Right Now:

1. **Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard**
2. **Settings → Build & Deployments** 
3. **Click "Edit Configuration"**
4. **Set Build Output Directory to:** `dist`

### 📋 Complete Configuration:

```
Framework preset: Vite
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist  ← THIS IS THE KEY SETTING!
Root directory: (leave blank)
```

### 🎯 Why This Matters:

**Current Issue:** Browser tries to load `/index.tsx` (TypeScript)
**Solution:** Browser should load `/assets/index-[hash].js` (compiled JS)

The `dist` folder contains:
- ✅ Compiled JavaScript with proper MIME types
- ✅ `_headers` file for Content-Type configuration  
- ✅ Optimized production build

### 🚀 After Setting Build Output Directory:

Your next deployment will:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Deploy from `/dist` folder
3. Serve compiled JavaScript files
4. Fix all MIME type errors

**This commit triggers a new deployment - set the build output directory now!**
