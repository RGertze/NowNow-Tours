# Deployment Verification Checklist

## ❌ Current Issue
Your site is serving raw TypeScript files instead of built JavaScript, causing MIME type errors.

## ✅ How to Verify Fix is Working

After updating Cloudflare Pages build settings, check these:

### 1. **Check Deployment Logs**
In Cloudflare Pages deployments, you should see:
```
✅ Installing dependencies with npm install
✅ Running build command: npm run build  
✅ Build output: 44 modules transformed
✅ Deployment from dist directory
```

### 2. **Check Network Tab in Browser**
- JavaScript files should load from `/assets/index-[hash].js`
- NOT from `/index.tsx` (raw TypeScript)
- Response headers should include proper `Content-Type: application/javascript`

### 3. **Check Console for Errors**
- No "MIME type" errors
- No "Failed to load module script" errors
- React app loads successfully

## 🚨 If Build Still Doesn't Run

If Cloudflare Pages still doesn't run the build:

1. **Double-check build settings** in dashboard
2. **Try Manual Deployment**:
   - Run `npm run build` locally
   - Upload the `dist/` folder contents manually to Cloudflare Pages
3. **Contact Cloudflare Support** if auto-build continues to fail

## 📋 Current Build Configuration
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Node.js version: `18` (from .nvmrc)
- Framework: Vite (detected automatically)
